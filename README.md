# Gradient Boosting on the Lending Club dataset

In this Mini Project we will explore the use of
pre-processing methods and Gradient Boosting on the popular Lending Club dataset. We
are provided with two files: loan train.csv and loan test.csv.

We have be to pre-process the data appropriately, and then apply gradient boosting to classify whether a customer should be given a loan or not.

The target attribute is in the column loan status, which has values “Fully
Paid” for which we can assign +1 to, and “Charged off” for which we can assign -1 to. The
other records with loan status values “Current” (in both train and test) are not relevant
to this problem.

We will be mainly working on the following:

    (a) Pre-process the data as needed to apply the classifier to the training data.

    (b) Apply gradient boosting using the function sklearn.ensemble.GradientBoostingClassifier
    for training the model.
